We blew the leaves off the turf into the beds and low spots, then ran multiple passes with a high-powered mower on mulch setting to break down what we could. The remaining leaf volume was raked into piles, bagged, and hauled. Storm branches were cut to manageable lengths, bundled, and set at the curb. Gutters were hand-cleared and flushed with a garden hose.

After edging, we installed fresh natural hardwood mulch at a 3-inch depth throughout both front beds, keeping it pulled back from the base of each shrub to prevent rot.\n\n## The Result\n\nThe transformation was dramatic. Clean edges create a strong visual separation between turf and beds, giving the property a well-maintained, intentional look. The fresh mulch ties the whole front together, adds a rich color contrast against the green lawn, and will suppress weeds through the winter.
