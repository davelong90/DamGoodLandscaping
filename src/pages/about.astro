          Dam Good Landscaping is a solo operation — just me, Dave, and the work
          I put into every yard I touch. No large crews, no corners cut, no jobs
          handed off to someone you never met.

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          I grew up taking care of my family's property in {site.city}. Mowing, trimming,
          hauling — it was just part of life. Over the years I picked up more skills and
          started helping neighbors out on the side. Eventually people started asking me
          to do the same for them, and Dam Good Landscaping was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not trying to be the biggest landscaping company in {site.state}. I am trying
          to be the most reliable one in your neighborhood. That means showing up when I
          say I will, doing the work I promised, and leaving the property cleaner than I
          found it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every job gets my full attention because every job has my name on it.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Offer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Lawn maintenance — mowing, edging, blowing</li>
          <li>Mulching and bed edging</li>
          <li>Shrub trimming and shaping</li>
          <li>Full yard cleanups and debris removal</li>
          <li>Seasonal work — spring and fall prep</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I look at the whole property before I quote anything. I want to understand
          what is going on before I give you a number. That way there are no surprises
          when the job is done — for either of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I document projects with before and after photos because I am proud of the
          work and I want you to have a record of what was done. It also holds me
          accountable. If I can't take a good after photo, I am not done.
        </p>

        <h3>Service Area</h3>
        <p>
          Based in {site.city}, {site.state} — serving the surrounding area. Not sure if I
          cover your neighborhood? Just ask. If it is reasonable, I will make it work.
        </p>
