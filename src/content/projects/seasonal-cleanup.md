excerpt: A full property fall cleanup — leaves cleared from lawn, beds, and gutters — so the yard heads into winter in good shape.

## The Problem

By late November this yard had accumulated a heavy layer of leaves from three large oak trees. The lawn underneath was being smothered, which can cause significant turf damage over winter. The planting beds were completely buried, branches had come down from a recent storm, and the gutters were clogged with debris. The homeowner was managing a new baby and simply had not had time to stay ahead of it.

## The Solution

We worked the property in sections, starting with the lawn. We blew the leaves off the turf into the beds and low spots, then ran multiple passes with a high-powered mower on mulch setting to break down what we could. The remaining leaf volume was raked into piles, bagged, and hauled. Storm branches were cut to manageable lengths, bundled, and set at the curb. Gutters were hand-cleared and flushed with a garden hose. Final pass with a blower to clean hardscapes.

## The Result

The lawn came through with no smothering damage — it will green up properly in spring. All beds are clear, hardscapes are clean, and gutters are flowing. The homeowner now books this service every fall, and we added a spring cleanup to the schedule as well.
