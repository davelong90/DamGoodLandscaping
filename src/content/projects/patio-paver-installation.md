excerpt: An unused, sloped backyard corner was transformed into a level paver patio with a built-in outdoor kitchen surround — a complete outdoor entertaining space built from scratch.

## The Problem

The backyard of this Greer property had a sloped, unused corner that the homeowners described as "wasted space." They had been planning an outdoor kitchen for years but had no flat surface to build on, and the existing lawn ran right up to the back of the house with no transition zone. The slope also caused erosion that deposited sediment against the foundation after heavy rains.

## The Solution

The project began with excavation and site leveling — we removed approximately 14 inches of grade across the 400-square-foot installation area to create a flat, properly sloped-for-drainage base. After compacting and installing a crushed stone base layer, we laid 2-inch thick concrete pavers in a running bond pattern. Along the back edge we built a reinforced block structure to serve as the base platform for the outdoor kitchen appliances and countertop, which the homeowners sourced separately. The surrounding lawn was re-edged and re-seeded where the excavation disturbed the turf, and a drainage channel was cut along the retaining edge to manage stormwater.

## The Result

The transformation here is dramatic in a way that photographs struggle to capture — the space went from an unusable slope to a defined, level outdoor room. The patio now hosts the family's grill station, a prep counter, and seating for six. The drainage issue against the foundation is resolved. This is the kind of project that changes how a family uses their property, and it is one of the most satisfying types of work we do.
