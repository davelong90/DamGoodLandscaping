excerpt: A front yard with bare, weedy beds and faded old mulch gets a full reset with clean edges and fresh hardwood mulch.

## The Problem

The front beds along this home had not been touched in over three years. The old mulch had broken down completely, weeds had taken hold, and the edges had gone soft and indistinct — grass was creeping into the beds from every direction. The overall effect made the house look neglected even though the homeowner kept the lawn mowed regularly.

## The Solution

We started by hand-pulling the worst of the weeds and raking out the old decomposed mulch. Once the beds were clean, we used a steel spade to re-cut crisp, defined edges along the entire frontage — about 80 linear feet of bed line. After edging, we installed fresh natural hardwood mulch at a 3-inch depth throughout both front beds, keeping it pulled back from the base of each shrub to prevent rot.

## The Result

The transformation was dramatic. Clean edges create a strong visual separation between turf and beds, giving the property a well-maintained, intentional look. The fresh mulch ties the whole front together, adds a rich color contrast against the green lawn, and will suppress weeds through the winter. The homeowner said the neighbors immediately noticed the difference.
