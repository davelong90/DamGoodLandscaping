## The Problem

The client wanted extra usable outdoor space in the front of the house and wanted to reduce the maintenance burden of an existing garden bed.

## The Solution

We maintained the current pathway leading to the door to keep the project on budget, then converted the garden bed into a new paver patio. The existing bed footprint gave us a natural, well-defined area to work with without disturbing the rest of the front yard.

## The Result

The client was very pleased with the results, which gave them a comfortable seating area right at the front of the house. They appreciated the creative approach that preserved the existing walkway to stay within budget while still delivering exactly what they were looking for.
