excerpt: A neglected backyard with patchy, weed-choked turf brought back to a lush, uniform lawn through deep cleanup, grading, and a consistent maintenance schedule.

## The Problem

This backyard had been left on its own for the better part of two seasons. Broadleaf weeds had taken over roughly 60% of the turf area, bare patches ran along both fence lines, and a low corner of the yard had become a standing water trap that killed off whatever tried to grow there. The homeowners had young kids and wanted a yard they could actually use — the current state made that impossible.

## The Solution

We started with a thorough mechanical cleanup: removing thatch buildup, hand-pulling the densest weed sections, and scalp-mowing the remaining turf to give new growth a clean start. The low corner required light regrading — we brought in topsoil and reshaped the grade to direct runoff away from the problem area. After grading, we overseeded the bare zones with a regionally appropriate turf blend suited to the Greenville, SC climate. The lawn then entered a bi-weekly maintenance rotation to keep it cut at the right height while the new seed established.

## The Result

Within six weeks the bare patches had filled in and the weeds had been crowded out by healthy, dense turf. The regraded corner dried up completely after the next rain event. The homeowners now have a flat, usable backyard their kids play in every afternoon. This project is a clear example of what consistent, properly executed maintenance can do — no chemicals, no shortcuts, just the right work done in the right order.
