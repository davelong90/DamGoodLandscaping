excerpt: Side-yard shrubs that had grown into each other and overtaken the walk were cut back, shaped, and cleaned up in a single visit.

## The Problem

The side beds on this property had not been trimmed in at least two seasons. Several large boxwoods had grown together into one continuous mass, completely obscuring a window and extending over the sidewalk by nearly two feet. Beneath the shrubs, years of leaf debris and dead branches had accumulated, creating a hiding spot for pests and holding moisture against the foundation.

## The Solution

We spent the first hour with hand pruners and loppers, opening up the interior of each shrub and removing all dead wood. Once the structure was cleaned out, we used powered hedge trimmers to shape each shrub individually — rounding the tops and bringing the sides back to a consistent depth. The accumulated debris under and around the shrubs was raked out, bagged, and hauled. We finished by cleaning the sidewalk and driveway.

## The Result

Each shrub now reads as its own defined plant rather than part of one overgrown mass. The walk is clear, the window is unobstructed, and the foundation is visible and properly aired out. Total job time was about four hours. The homeowner had been dreading the project for a year — seeing it finished in an afternoon made a big impression.
